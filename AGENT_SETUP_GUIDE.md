## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Registration Flow:
1. User visits `/agent/register`
2. Fills in registration form
3. System validates input (password match, length, etc.)
4. Calls API: `POST /api/auth/register` with role="agent"
5. Receives token and user data
6. Saves to localStorage
7. Redirects to `/agent/dashboard`

### Login Flow:
1. User visits `/agent/login`
2. Enters email and password
3. System validates credentials
4. Calls API: `POST /api/auth/login`
5. Validates user role is "agent"
6. Saves token and user data to localStorage
7. Redirects to `/agent/dashboard`

### Dashboard Access:
1. User tries to access `/agent/dashboard/*`
2. AgentGuard checks for token and user data
3. Validates role is "agent"
4. If valid: Shows dashboard
5. If invalid: Redirects to `/agent/login`

---

## 💾 LocalStorage Keys

The system uses these localStorage keys:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem("agentToken", token);     // JWT token
localStorage.setItem("agentUser", JSON.stringify(user)); // User data
```

## 🚦 How to Test

### 1. Register a New Agent
```bash
# Navigate to
http://localhost:5173/agent/register

# Or click "Đăng ký trở thành Agent" link from login page
```

### 2. Login as Agent
```bash
# Navigate to
http://localhost:5173/agent/login

# Or click "Login" in header, then select "Đăng nhập / Đăng ký Agent"
```

### 3. Access Dashboard
```bash
# After login, you'll be automatically redirected to:
http://localhost:5173/agent/dashboard
```

### 4. Test Navigation
- Click sidebar links to navigate between sections
- Test logout button
- Try accessing protected routes without login (should redirect)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials" error
- Check if backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Verify email and password are correct

### Dashboard redirects to login
- Check if token exists in localStorage
- Verify user role is "agent"
- Try logging in again

### CORS errors
- Ensure Laravel backend has CORS properly configured
- Check if API endpoints are accessible
